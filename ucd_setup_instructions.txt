1. Install Urbancode based on documentation given by ibm: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/urbancode-deploy/7.0.4?topic=installing
2. Once the agent is installed on deployment server we need to attach the same to the resource tree of the ucd
3. After this, create the environment and application for jenkins where we can deploy our applications. 
sample environment name='dev' and application name='DeployToCloud'
4. After creation of application next step is to create a component for application (sample component name='vueComponent'). In this component we can define the whole process of deployment.
5. Refer to vueComponentProcess.txt for process related details
6. Once all this is done, this component needs to be attached to application and then we need to attach it to the resource agent.
7. After component addition, application process needs to be created where only one step needs to be defined i.e. to install vueComponent component.
sample application process name: ApplicationProcess-vueComponent

why all these are needed?
when jenkins connect to ucd, it goes to the defined environment given on jenkinfile then on given application. From there it looks for application process of the component which installs
the actual component where the process is defined and then it executes the process of the given component.
The component is attached to the deployment server( in resource agent) so the process is getting executed on your deployment server.
